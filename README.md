Simulation and Models II Project: Utilizing Colab Notebooks to Implement Machine Learning for Home Loan Approval Prediction (Classification) üè°‚ú®


Made By David Upegui Londo√±o [@DavidUpegui], Daniel Tabares Pavas [@DanielTabares1] and Ferney Alonso Montoya Gallo [@FerneyMontoya6] as final project for Models & System Simulations II course   

The project consists of 2 phases:

Data cleaning
Implementation of models
For data cleaning, make sure to correctly use the path to your data. At the end of this section, you will find a cell that allows you to save the clean data. In this section, you should also manipulate the path variable to save the .csv file wherever you desire.

Before each model implementation, a cell is executed to load the data. The data to be loaded should be the one that is already cleaned and prepared for the implementations. Again, remember to manipulate the path variable if necessary.

Searching for the best parameters for Gradient Boosting Tree and Support Vector Machine algorithms is slow: it takes 17 minutes and 45 minutes respectively. Some other cells in the notebook might also take a while to complete (especially the training ones).
